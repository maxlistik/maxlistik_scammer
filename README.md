One day this guy contacted me, offering to make a video about my project for $60 "GOOD ADVERTISEMENT for you!" he said. I was all like, "Wow really? Thats awesome (not really but you get the point)". We agreed and he started to ask for more, 5000 TRX (~$125 that time) first, then another 5000 TRX because (i mean who knows why really, read yourself its cryptic) i decided to give it a try because, well why not. Twice. I gave him more money; Twice! Yes stupid me...

Next day i wake up, still not to sure if i got scammed. But no video? "How is it going i asked?" and it begun again, "3000 TRX!!" he said, and then a day full of begging and whining for those 1-3k? TRX started. "Fool me once, fool me twice, but a third time? I want my video!!"

Did i get it? **Well no**
Did i get my money back? **No**
Was it worth the nerves? **Oh fucking hell no**

If you get contacted from this buy, better just say no and move on!
